# Permissions
Every file and directory in your UNIX/Linux system has following 3 permissions:

- *Read permission*: The user can read or check the content of the file.
- *Write permission*: The user can edit or modify the file.
- *Execute permission*: The user can execute the file.

And here are some of the commands to change or give permissions to a file.

- `chmod`: chmod (short for change mode) command is used to manage file system access permissions on Unix and Unix-like systems. 
- `sudo`: Sudo stands for SuperUser DO and is used to access restricted files and operations.
- `su`: It stands for 'substitute user' (or historically 'superuser'), is used by a computer user to execute commands with the privileges of another user account.
- `chown`: It changes the owner of the file or directory specified by the File or Directory parameter to the user specified by the Owner parameter.
- `chgrp`: The chgrp (change group) command alters the group name that a file or directory belongs to.
- `id`: The id command without any arguments shows the the user and group names and numeric IDs, of the calling process.
- `groups`: groups command prints the names of the primary and any supplementary groups for each given username, or the current process if no names are given.
- `whoami`: The whoami command displays a username associated with the effective user ID.
- `adduser`: It creates a new user or group.
- `useradd`: It creates a new user account.
- `addgroup`: It add a new group to your current Linux machine.
