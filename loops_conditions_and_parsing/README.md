# Loops and Conditions
### Loops
Loops allow us to take a series of commands and keep re-running them until a particular situation is reached. They are useful for automating repetitive tasks.

*Simple syntax*

```bash
while [ condition ];
do
    # statements
    # commands
done  
```

### Conditions
The conditional statement is used in any programming language to do any decision-making tasks. This statement is also used in bash to perform automated tasks like another programming language, just the syntax is a little bit different in bash.

*Simple syntax*

```bash
if [condition]
then
   statement1
else
   statement2
fi
```
